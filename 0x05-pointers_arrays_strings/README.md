# 0x05-POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS

## TASK 0. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as param           eter and updates the value it points to to.

## TASK 1. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

		    - Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

## TASK 2. Write a function that returns the length of a string.

			- Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

## TASK 3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new           line, to stdout.

			- Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

## TASK 4. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, follo           wed by a new line.

			- Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

## TASK 5. Write a function that reverses a string.

			- Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

## TASK 6. Write a function that prints every other character of a            string, starting with the first character, followed by a           new line.

			- Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

## TASK 7. Write a function that prints half of a string, followed            by a new line.

			- Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
			- The function should print the second half of the stri				 ng
			- If the number of characters is odd, the function shou				 ld print the last n characters of the string, where n 				= (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

## TASK 8. Write a function that prints n elements of an array of i           ntegers, followed by a new line.

		    - Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
		    - where n is the number of elements of the array to be 			     printed
		    - Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a sp               ace
			- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as				 they are stored in the array
			- You are allowed to use printf

## TASK 9.  - Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
		   Write a function that copies the string pointed to by sr           c, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buff           er pointed to by dest.

			- Return value: the pointer to dest
